     ```  
  2. Open `file1.txt` with `vi` and add the text "Hello, world!". Save and exit.  
- **Discussion:** Briefly explain the difference between `touch` and `vi`.  

---

#### **4. Viewing and Managing Directory Contents**  
- **Purpose:** Use `ls` and its options to explore file listings.  
- **Task:**  
  1. View all files:  
     ```bash  
     ls  
     ```  
  2. View hidden files:  
     ```bash  
     ls -a  
     ```  
  3. Combine options to display detailed information:  
     ```bash  
     ls -la  
     ```  
- **Discussion:** Explain combining options and interpreting output (`permissions`, `owner`, `size`, `timestamp`).  

---

#### **5. File and Directory Operations**  
- **Purpose:** Learn essential file management commands.  
- **Task:**  
  1. Rename `file1.txt` to `myfile.txt`:  
     ```bash  
     mv file1.txt myfile.txt  
     ```  
  2. Copy `myfile.txt` to `subdir`:  
     ```bash  
     cp myfile.txt subdir/  
     ```  
  3. Delete `myfile.txt`:  
     ```bash  
     rm myfile.txt  
     ```  
  4. Delete `subdir`:  
     ```bash  
     rm -r subdir  
     ```  
- **Discussion:** Emphasize that directories must be empty before deletion without `-r`.  

---

#### **6. Pipes and Redirection**  
- **Purpose:** Understand how to combine commands and redirect output.

  1. Create a file with numbers:  
     ```bash  
     seq 1 10 > numbers.txt  
     ```  
  2. Use a pipe to count lines:  
     ```bash  
     cat numbers.txt | wc -l  
     ```  
- **Discussion:** Explain `>` (overwrite), `>>` (append), and the purpose of `|`.  

---

#### **7. Permissions and `chmod`**  
- **Purpose:** Practice setting file permissions.  
- **Task:**  
  1. Create a file:  
     ```bash  
     touch testfile  
     ```  
  2. Set permissions:  
     ```bash  
     chmod 754 testfile  
     ```  
  3. Check permissions:  
     ```bash  
     ls -l testfile  
     ```  
- **Discussion:** Break down `rwxrwxrwx` and numeric representation.  

---

#### **8. Script Creation and Execution**  
- **Purpose:** Learn how to write and execute a basic shell script.  
- **Task:**  
  1. Open a new script file:  
     ```bash  
     vi script.sh

     ```bash  
     #!/bin/bash  
     echo "Hello, Linux!"

     ```bash  
     chmod +x script.sh  
     ```  
  4. Execute:  
     ```bash  
     ./script.sh
